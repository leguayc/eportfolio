                        <p>This website is developed with React.js, and React Three Fiber (Three.js). I choose this stack since I wanted to try three.js, and develop my skills on React.</p>
                        <p>I used the various skills I gained by developing video games on three.js to make it happen and to optimize the WebGL scene.</p>

                        <p>I worked as a full-stack developer for one year on MyBlazon.com, a website that generates blazon online. It's developed in .NET 6, and HTML, LESS, and JS (with Jquery) for the front.</p>
                        <p>I had many tasks, to tell a few : I refactored and migrated the website to .NET 6 (it was in .NET 4.5 before), I improved the website design, and the blazon generator by developing new features for it, and finally, I also trained other interns.</p>

                        <p>Working on this big project with a small team made me take on many jobs : UI/UX designer, developer (AI, UI, and many more), scriptwriter, etc...</p>

                        <p>I worked on Ederia Interactive's website. It's developed in Angular 10, the news system was done with Markdown, and the website is deployed with Docker. </p>
                        <p>I was alone on this project. I had to design a mock-up, develop the website and its news system.</p>

                        <p>I had to talk with each team to figure out their needs, and then develop the web application.</p>

                        <p>As my first project on Unity, I developed a flappy bird clone. I wanted to try out the game engine and to learn how to use it.</p>
                        <p>I learned how to use different aspects of the engine by programming the character's and the obstacle's movements, the obstacle generator, the score system, and menu scenes.</p>

                        <p>I developed Huun in a team of 10 for a PhD student. The mobile application was developed in React Native, and the website (back-office) with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.</p>
                        <p>My tasks were to program the settings related views (settings, about, credits), and the notification system (a key feature needed for the study).</p>
