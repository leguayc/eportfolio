                        <p>I worked as a full-stack developer for one year on MyBlazon.com, a website that generates blazon online. It's developed in .NET 6, and HTML, LESS, and JS (with Jquery) for the front.</p>
                        <p>I had many tasks, to tell a few : I refactored and migrated the website to .NET 6 (it was in .NET 4.5 before), I improved the website design, and the blazon generator by developing new features for it, and finally, I also trained other interns.</p>

                        <p>I worked on Ederia Interactive's website. It's developed in Angular 10, the news system was done with Markdown, and the website is deployed with Docker. </p>
                        <p>I was alone on this project. I had to design a mock-up, develop the website and its news system.</p>

                        <p>I had to talk with each team to figure out their needs, and then develop the web application.</p>

                        <p>I developed Huun in a team of 10 for a PhD student. The mobile application was developed in React Native, and the website (back-office) with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.</p>
                        <p>My tasks were to program the settings related views (settings, about, credits), and the notification system (a key feature needed for the study).</p>
