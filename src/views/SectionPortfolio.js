                        <p>I worked as a full-stack developer for one year on MyBlazon.com, a website that generates blazon online. It's developed in .NET 6, and HTML, LESS, and JS (with Jquery) for the front.</p>
                        <p>My tasks were numerous, and to tell a few, I had to migrate the website to .NET 6 (it was in .NET 4.5 before) and refactor it, to improve the website design, and the blazon generator with new features, and train the other interns.</p>

                        <p>Working on this big project with a small team made me take on many jobs : UI/UX designer, developer (AI, UI, and many more), scriptwriter, etc...</p>

                        <p>Website for Ederia Interactive, my video game studio so we can post news about our games. Developed with Angular 10, and deployed with Docker.</p>
                        <p>I worked alone on the project. I had to design a mock-up, develop the website and its news system (working with Markdown).</p>

                        <p>As an intern for 3 months at Click & Boat, I developed a monitoring tool that was destined to run on Raspberry Pi, and displayed on screens in the office of each team. It was done in Angular, and HighchartsJS.</p>
                        <p>I had to talk with each team to figure out their needs, and then develop the web application.</p>

                        <p>I developed Huun in a team of 10 for a PhD student that studied attention improvements with meditation. The mobile application needed to give tests to the users to train was linked to a website to display the results of the tests. The app was developed in React Native, and the website with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.</p>
                        <p>My tasks were to program the settings related views (settings, about, credits), and the notification system (a key feature needed for the study).</p>
